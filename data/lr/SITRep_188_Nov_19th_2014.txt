The trend line shows the number of the laboratory confirmed cases of Ebola per day in Liberia The number for each day is presented as the 
mean of the last 7 days Thereby the day to day variations are eliminated in order to show the time trend more clearly Duplicate samples 
from the same patient have been removed from the data presented above From the beginning of November no such duplication remain
The above trend curve is presently the best representation available for the Ebola Epidemic in Liberia but throughout the months covered 
there are cases mainly deaths in the communities that are not diagnosed
There are no evidance from community studies and obeservations  that the number of missed cases per day have increased since the peak of 
the epidemic It is difficult to estimate how many cases are missed per day but the numer of investigation of identified smaller outbreaks in 
remote communities suggests that they mainly occure in remote rural areas and that the numbers are small in the Montserrato county 
including the capital Monrovia  It seems unprobable that the number of missed cases per day constitute a higher number than those that are 
confirmed
